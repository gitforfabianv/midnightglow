# Welcome to Midnight Glow

Midnight Glow is a handcrafted theme built for clarity, emotion, and a touch of neon nostalgia. Designed almost exclusively with HTML, CSS, and Jekyll, it embraces the elegance of static architecture while pushing visual boundaries.
This theme is a celebration of modular overlays, and expressive grids. From glow-stick style accents to pseudo-random color pulses, every detail is tuned for both technical robustness and visual delight.
üîç The only exception? The search bar‚Äîpowered by a lightweight JavaScript layer to deliver dynamic results without compromising the purity of the stack.
üõ†Ô∏è Ongoing Development
Midnight Glow is a living project. As new quirks surface and better solutions emerge, improvements will be made iteratively. Expect refinements in layout logic, accessibility, and theme integration as the project evolves.
Whether you're here to browse, debug, or remix, I hope you find something that glows!
